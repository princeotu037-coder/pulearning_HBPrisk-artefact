## **Overview**  

Project presents a **Hypertension (HBP) Risk Prediction System** using **Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Learning**. The system consists of:  

- **Machine Learning Model** â€“ Biased SVM trained to predict hypertension risk.  
- **Backend (Flask API)** â€“ Serves real-time predictions.  
- **Frontend (React.js + Tailwind CSS)** â€“ Web-based interface for user-friendly input.  
- **Deployment** â€“ Flask API on **Render**, Frontend on **Cloudflare Pages**.  

ðŸš€ **Live Demo:**  
- **Frontend**: [HBP Risk Prediction](https://pulearning-hbprisk-artefact.pages.dev/)  
- **API Endpoint**: [HBP Risk API](https://pulearning-hbp-risk.onrender.com)  
- **Info**: API endpoint is hosted on a free server and so first time running of the frontend app takes a while to load.

## **PU Learning (Biased SVM Model)**  

- Instead of traditional supervised learning, this model learns from **Positive (HBP cases)** and **Unlabeled (PU) data**, where negative cases are uncertain.  Weighted logistic pu learning as well as Pu bagging were trained but Biased svm showed robust results with prediction and was therefore chosen.
- **Biased SVM** assigns lower importance to unlabeled data to improve classification accuracy.  




## **ðŸš€ Deployment & API Usage**
